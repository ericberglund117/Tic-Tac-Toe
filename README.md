# Tic-Tac-Toe
Final solo project for Turing Mod1
A Javascript driven project by Eric Berglund.

## Introduction


## Progression

Iteration 1 -


Iteration 2 -




Iteration 3 -




Iteration 4 -



Iteration 5


## Key Concepts and Challenges

__Key Concepts__

- class creation
- instantiating a class
- Creating a new instance of a class and passing an object through as an argument
- object oriented pogramming

__Challenges__

- Checking for wins
- Creating and updating win counter per player
- Restarting the game after a win or draw

- These were challenges because the checking for wins function would iterate through the players moves and the winning combos, but it wouldn't define a winner if those arrays matched. The others were an issue because I couldn't update those functions if a winner was not detected.
